### I lost my key ? What can I do
We warn our users about keeping their keys safe on multiple places on the website (including the signup page where you received this key in the first place). If you lost a private key, it is totally unrecoverable. If the key was only a custom key, then you can login with your master key and delete this custom key, and make a new one.

If you lost your master key, then you have lost ownership of this account, and we recommend you to make a new one. If you still have access to a custom key with financial operations allowed, you will be able to transfer your funds to your new account.

Remember that you always need to keep your key backed up somewhere (save it at two different places at least). DTube Chain uses cryptographic keys as logins. While much more secure than a password, we will never be able to retrieve your keys if lost.
