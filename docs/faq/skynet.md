#### Skynet
[Skynet](https://siasky.net/) is a next-gen decentralized protocol focused on putting the users in control of their content. Content is identified by a Skylink, which can be used to verify the file hasn't been changed since the original upload, making your content trustable.
Anyone running a Skynet node can access any file on Skynet. There are multiple portals around the world which enable users to access content without downloading special software.
You can use Sia-UI to easily upload content to Skynet from a desktop or laptop. Unlike other solutions, once you have uploaded a file your computer does not need to remain online for the file to be available continuously. The Sia network will seed the file for you.
