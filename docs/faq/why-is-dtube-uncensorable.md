# Why is Dtube uncensorable?

Because of the decentralized nature of IPFS and the Avalon blockchain, D.Tube is not able to censor videos, nor enforce guidelines. Only the users can censor it, through the power of their upvotes and downvotes.
IPFS is a protocol that enables decentralized file storage. The principle behind it is called Distributed Hash Tables (DHT). The same principle also powers the BitTorrent network. Just like how cryptocurrency uses asymmetrical cryptography, DHT networks will hash contents in order to be able to identify a file. The hash becomes the identifier of a file, and it's as easy as re-hashing a file and making sure the hashes match to ensure the file that was sent to us is the original.

## Community self-moderation

In a world of disinformation and algorithmic moderation, community ranking proved the most accurate mechanism to rate and organize any kind of information on the web (restaurants, real estate, movies, etc.)
With Avalon, content is ranked exclusively by user’s upvotes, downvotes and tags. A popular piece of content
(i.e. with lots of upvotes) goes up in its category to gain more exposure and a submission with a negative score
is automatically hidden. Adult content is tagged “NSFW” and hidden by default (an account is required to view
this content);
All platform moderation guidelines come from a community consensus.
