## Can I change my account name ?
There is no central entity in the blockchain , we don't have any authority over your accounts key or assets. Therefore there is no way to delete a blockchain account or change the name of it.

If you are not happy with your accounts name it is totally okay to get yourself a second account from [here](https://d.tube/newaccount) (will be available once we are on the main-net).
