Third party video providers is a great way to ensure that your video is watchable at highest qualities. It's never a bad thing to add a third party video source.
If you want to share a non-original video on DTube, this is the recommended way, as it will reward the original creator registered on these third party websites.
If you create original content, these solutions should not be your first choice as these platforms will most often force you to give them your personal data and/or put ads on top of your videos. Censorship or country restriction can also hurt the availability of your videos.

### File upload to our servers
DTube provides a free video upload service, that encodes your video, creates a sprite, and stores all these files on a decentralized network (BTFS). However, this service has serious limitations:
Maximum quality is 480p
Videos longer than 20 minutes will not get re-encoded, only stored
Videos with low views and older than 6 months might get deleted
These limitations may not apply to 3rd party upload endpoints not operated by DTube. Please check with the respective upload endpoint providers regarding the limitations associated with the use of such upload endpoints.
