## Creating Documentation for DTube

Possible areas of improvement:

- Fixing mistakes (typos, poor wording)
- Clarifying things which are confusing
- Adding new sections/pages
- Fixing broken links
- Changing the structure where appropriate
- Removing inconsistencies

### Guidelines

Most things aren't set in stone, but it's good to have some basic guidelines for everyone to use.

#### Links instead of duplication

When you have a piece of information that applies generally, consider placing it in a general place. Ex.: DTube's official social media accounts. You could place links to our social media in a page you're working on, but that creates issues: now we have two places with the same or similar information. 

If DTube opens another official account on a different platform, your information is now out of date. Worse even: the two sets of information may contradict one another, if something changes. Someone would have to remember to update both places and most likely this won't happen. 

Remember: anyone can get any link to any page in the documentation at any time. The user needs (and deserves) a coherent, professional experience.

By using [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links), you're solving this problem. Now, that piece of information has to be updated in one place only. This makes the documentation much easier to maintain and expand.
