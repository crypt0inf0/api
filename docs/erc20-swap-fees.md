On the **Ethereum** blockchain, gas refers to the cost necessary to perform a transaction on the network. **Avalon** blockchain doesn't have any fees for transactions. However, when you are swapping **Dtube Coin** to **Wrapped Dtube Coin(WDTC)** you need to interact with Ethereum blockchain and need to pay the gas fee. Because of that  there will be a fee paid in Dtube coin which is equivalent to the price of 1 transaction on Ethereum Blockchain.
