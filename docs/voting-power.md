## What Voting Power?
Voting power (VP) is the unit used for voting on videos, and ranking them. A video with more total VP on its upvotes will rank higher in hot and trending categories.

## How is VP generated?
VP generates off your DTC balance, at the rate of +1 VP / DTC / hour.

Unlike Steem or Hive, your VP on DTube has no limit and will keep growing even if your account is inactive.

## How is VP spent?
VP is spent anytime you publish a new video, upvote/downvote a video, comment on a video, upvote/downvote a comment. A moving slider will ask you for a % of your available voting power to spend on the current vote.

Voting at 100% will spend all your available power, so if you want to vote frequently on videos, it's a better idea to vote for lower amounts such as 5, 10, or 20%.
