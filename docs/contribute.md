## Coding

If you don't know what to work on but want to help, please work on issues listed on each repository tagged as *bug* or *enhancement*.

However, it's also perfectly okay to submit pull requests for something you just want, even if it's not listed in the issues. Just understand that for this case not everything will get merged if it doesn't gather enough approval from other developers.

As you can see from the repos list, we try to use Javascript whenever we can to get a job done. You can still, however, contribute in another programming language by creating a new repository.

## Design/UX

Project files (ex. `*.pdf` or `*.ai`) are sadly not enough. We need CSS sheets and images submitted directly to the appropriate repositories (ex. *UI* or *Player*). This is so everyone can test the design in real life and understand the look and feel of it. **This makes your and our job much easier. Thank you!**

## Documentation

**Documentation is a great way to get started**: [here you can learn more](contribute-to-docs.md).

## Translations

**DTube is being translated into more than 50 languages**, and all of this is happening **thanks to our wonderful community members**. With your valued help DTube could soon be available in your language!

Visit our [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/dtube) project and sign up.

1. Find a language you would like to contribute to
1. Chose your contribution type: voting on new translations, improving existing ones or creating new translations for your language
   1. You can leave a message to project managers about translations in Crowdin
1. After approval the changes will be applied to one of the next patches.


## Questions?

Feel free to reach out through [our social media](README.md#contact-us). You can get in touch with any team member about merge requests, questions or ideas.

Another way to send bug reports and feature requests is through GitHub. Go to the appropriate repository and create a new issue if there isn't one already ([like here](https://github.com/dtube/dtube/issues)).
