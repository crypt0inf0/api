## NSFW definition:
Not Safe For Work. Used to describe Internet content generally inappropriate for the typical workplace, i.e., would not be acceptable in the presence of your boss and colleagues (as opposed to SFW, Safe For Work).

## Can I publish NSFW content on Dtube?

Yes you can. However you need to make adjustments from your account about NSFW content. You also need to tag your content accordingly (#nsfw) otherwise it will be flagged by the community, reducing your rewards and affect the content visibility.
